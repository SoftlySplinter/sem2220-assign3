\section{Introduction}
This report details the process undertaken to produce an Android widget based 
on the existing code to load sessions from a SQLite database. This widget had 
several requirements, including the ability to select different days from the 
database as well as provide notifications read from a remote URL.

\section{Design}
The widget was designed in accordance with the Android App Widget Design 
Guidelines\cite{google2013widget}, which define guides for design constraints 
like the minimum and maximum size of the widget, layouts and backgrounds, etc.

To help conform to these guidelines, the template design 
pack\cite{google2013widgettemplates} provided by the Android Open Source 
Project under the Apache 2 License was used to design the widget. 

A mock version of the widget was created to view how it would appear on a 
device. From this is became obvious that the widget would need to be four 
cells wide (the maximum) by at least two cells tall.

This size would allow a view with the following information on it:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A title for the Widget
  \item Two buttons, one to move backwards through days and one to move forward
        through days
  \item A list of the sessions available for the specified day.
  \item The notification loaded from a remote site.
\end{itemize}

To keep the buttons accessible, they were made such that their minimum size was
a single cell each and surrounded the list of sessions to make the flow of data
natural. To conform to the iconography standards\cite{google2013iconography},
another resource was used from the Android Open Source Project; the Action Bar 
Icon Pack\cite{google2013iconpack}.

The notification display was kept small so that it would not obstruct the view
of the data, but so that it would be easy to see at a glance. Finally, the 
title was given colour, based on the recommended 
colours\cite{google2013colour}, a purely aesthetic element.

Figure~\ref{fig:widget_design} shows the evolution of the design for the 
widget.


\section{Development}

Most of the development was based on the documentation of Android App 
Widget\cite{google2013appwidgets}. Following this resource, the API and some 
examples from both the Android Open Source Project and textbook codes 
samples\cite{murphy2009android}. With these resources it was a fairly simple 
matter to implement the basic widget.

All the development for the widget was kept in a separate Android project. The
first action was to import the \texttt{DataAccess} class provided into this 
project. The next step was to create a class which implemented 
\texttt{AppWidgetProvider}. This used the layout shown in the previous section
and a \texttt{RemoteViews} object to manipulate the elements in that layout.

To enable the loading of list content, subclasses \texttt{RemoteViewsService} 
and \texttt{RemoteViewsFactory} were created. The service simply provides this 
factory, whilst the service loads content into the list from the SQLite3 
database using the \texttt{DataAccess} class.

This brought forward a problem; the SQLite3 table row IDs defined in
\texttt{ConferenceCP} did not match the actual SQLite3 row IDs provided. This
lead to incorrect data being provided by the \texttt{DataAccess} class. Fixing
this was a simple matter of changing these IDs to match the right IDs, but this
may not apply to other implementations of SQLite3 (the version exported works
in SQLite version 3.7.11, on the Android Emulator running on Linux Mint 14 
Cinnamon 64-bit).

To improve the loading of Sessions, a POJO\cite{fowler2000pojo} was created to
represent a session and an additional method for loading this POJO was added 
into the \texttt{DataAccess} class. The same thing was created to load a Date
object from the database as the Session requires this. With these POJOs it was
easy to display this in the list rows.

The next task was to implement the next day and previous day functionality. 
Initially the code for this was doing the widget provider. The buttons would 
send a broadcast (either next or previous) to the provider and then to forcibly
call the \texttt{onUpdate} method to reset the broadcasts and list service.

However, talking to a fellow classmate (Gareth Williams) the easier way to do
this was to send a broadcast to the service directly and just notify the App
Widget Manager that the data for the list had changed.

Finally, to download the notification an \texttt{AsyncTask} was implemented to
handle the URL connection as it cannot be done in the Android main thread. The
code for this is fairly standard and the correct permissions had to be set in
the manifest file.


\section{Testing}
All testing was performed using the Android emulator. Most of this testing
involved using the widget to ensure it worked correctly. Actually unit testing
the code would have been fairly trivial as it only really integrated existing
code and displayed it in layouts.


\section{Evaluation}


Breaking down the mark scheme the author has predicted the grade which should 
be given for each part, this is shown in table~\ref{tab:marks}.

Therefore, the author feels a mark of 82\% should be awarded. The values chosen 
were based on the following reasons:

\begin{description}
\item[Documentation] 
\item[Implementation] 
\item[Flair] 
\item[Testing] 
\end{description}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
\textbf{Part} & \textbf{Worth} & \textbf{Predicted Grade} \\ \hline
Documentation & 30\% & 25\% \\ 
Implementation & 50\% & 45\% \\ 
Flair & 10\% & 5\% \\ 
Testing & 10\% & 7\% \\ \hline
